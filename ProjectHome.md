# KML Converter Introduction #

Application was developed as part of my final year project at City University London.
At the moment it provides basic functionality of converting coordinates from DMS format into decimal degrees, converting altitude values from various units of measurement to meters and grouping placemarks into folders.

I intend to make further improvements to this application, therefore any comments and feature requests are welcome.

Best regards,
